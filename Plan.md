## Plan
* Longitude and Latitude will be mapped to a rectangle
* Payment will be mapped to jet color(get max and min from python)
* Time_diff will be the z axis 

* Allow user to filter results

* Indeed lines look too simple/too much of a tower
    * Two planes, one bigger than the other
    * 

## Implementations
* try texturing string onto different shapes

* Get map onto 3d 
* test complete mapping on san francisco
* decide on data structure for points/functions


## Steps
* change temp variables in projectWorldCoordinates
* set cutoff point for payments
* scale/set cutoff for time??

* profile code
