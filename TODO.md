## Plan
* See what made bike project turn out so well
* Decide on visualization


## Tips
* hue color mode instead of rgb
* look at previous 3d projects to see what words to put on project
* Just one object
* Add project description in main.pde

## Ideas
* Simple Map + Lots of Data
* Transportation
* Objects on a white grid
* Sphere/Circle best for 3D-> how about the bike project though?
* Convolution?

* Neuroscience-> signals lighting up
### What has connections/complicated adjency matrix


### Final Idea
I don't like how I have to solely rely on Google Maps to get around. I should be able to see:
    * what buses are around
    * where do they approximately go
* Map transit of sf muni to neurons, 
    * with height dictated by elevation.
    * size of neuron dictated by number of different buses that stop at that station.
    * multiple connections(b/c of buses to the same point) follow a roots of unity separation.
**How can I have more than one neuron on the z axis?**. W.E
* Multiple evolutions of a 3(can be mapped down) parameter system with "random" nodes
    * 3 numerical parameters should be easy to get
    * what systems have a start and end?
        * transportation
        * checkin/checkout

* convert distance to taxicab distance?

### Final Idea Again
* I think networks are too hard to allow data to decide the visualization.

* well associations can create the fractal/river that I want
* accept that I do not have enough artistic abilities to make a network


### Generalization of Arc Diagram
* mirror instead of onto
* surface instead of plane

* So arc diagrams are used to represent associations between categorical data. The disadvantage is that it gives a artifical notion of distance. Force directed layouts solve this problem by making the distance a function of the data.
    * How are the links determined? Thickness is the magnitude of something. Links are some type of transaction/distance.
